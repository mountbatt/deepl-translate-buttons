# deepl-translate-buttons
A tiny WordPress Plugin to implement DeepL-Translation into every admin input field or textarea. 
Its perfect to fasten the translation of ACF-Fields or other custom fields â€¦
Editors have to register a free or pro API Account at [DeepL.com](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api).

It also works on large classic editor posts and DeepLs AI will preserve code fragments too!

Additionally you can create automatic ALT-Tags with AI via astica API. The results get translated via DeepL and attached to the uploaded images.

## Settings:
You need the url to the API (free or pro) and your own API-Key:
